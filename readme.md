### MH Database Optimizer (QB) (Server Side Only)
- Well the name says it all, it cleans up your database with useless data,
- this optimize your database like requests and search to the database.
- When you have a limited database or not this helps you keep it clean,
- it uses only the data that is realy needed and all other data that is useless will be removed.

### Why i made this?
- well i see scripts that don't think of this and keep adding useless data into the database or in metadata and never remove it.
- like the inventory there are inventories that are no longer exsist or even used,
- same for vehicles that you use on the server, it can be a player owned vehicle but nolonger exist on the server
- this are a few examples that it is useless data and why you want to keep it in your database?
- That's why i created this script cause i don't like useless data in my database,
- this also optimize your database like requests and search to the database.

### When server start this happend
**Inventory Stashes/Trunks/Dumpsters optimize**
- This are inventories that are empty or has no items in it, like trunks from vehicles that does not exist anymore,
- it also remove any inventory that is empty cause when you use it it will be created again be the inventory if it still exsist
- and when you put items in it it will stay remain and it does not delete the inventory cause it is used and has items.
- Useless data that never will be used again, so removed it and keep it clean.

**Player vehicles optimize**
- This only happen when vehicles does not exsist on the server, than player owned vehicles will be removed from the database.
- Useless data that never will be used again, so removed it and keep it clean.

**Metadata vehicleKeys optimize**
- This cleansup the player metadata vehiclekeys, cause it can be that you have keys that no longer exsist.
- Useless data that never will be used again, so removed it and keep it clean.
